# CSS corner-shape Property

## What is corner-shape?

The `corner-shape` CSS property is an experimental property that allows you to customize the shape of a box's corners beyond traditional rounded corners. It works in conjunction with the `border-radius` property to create various corner styles like squircles, beveled corners, notched corners, and more.

## Understanding corner-shape

The `corner-shape` property modifies how rounded corners are rendered. While `border-radius` controls the size of the rounded area, `corner-shape` determines the actual shape of those corners. This enables designers and developers to create more sophisticated and unique corner styles that go beyond simple circular rounding.

## Corner Shape Values

The `corner-shape` property accepts several keyword values and the `superellipse()` function:

### Keyword Values

- **`round`** - The default value. Creates traditional rounded corners (circular arcs), which is the same effect as using `border-radius` alone without `corner-shape`.

- **`square`** - Removes any corner rounding, effectively canceling out the `border-radius` and creating sharp, square corners.

- **`bevel`** - Creates chamfered or beveled corners by drawing a straight line between the two ends of the `border-radius`, creating a diagonal cut effect.

- **`squircle`** - Creates a squircle shape (a rounded square), which is a superellipse with a specific curve that creates a smooth transition between straight edges and rounded corners.

- **`scoop`** - Creates inward-curved corners, creating a concave or "scooped out" appearance at each corner.

- **`notch`** - Creates notched corners, where the corner is cut inward at a 45-degree angle, creating a distinctive notched appearance.

### Custom Values with superellipse()

The `superellipse()` function allows you to create custom corner shapes by specifying a rate parameter:

```css
corner-shape: superellipse(0.6);
corner-shape: superellipse(-1.2);
```

The rate parameter controls the curvature:
- Positive values create outward curves (similar to round or squircle)
- Negative values create inward curves (similar to scoop)
- Values closer to 0 create more square-like shapes
- Higher absolute values create more pronounced curves

## Syntax

The `corner-shape` property can accept one to four values, similar to `border-radius`:

```css
/* Single value - applies to all four corners */
corner-shape: bevel;

/* Two values - top-left & bottom-right, top-right & bottom-left */
corner-shape: notch superellipse(0.6);

/* Three values - top-left, top-right & bottom-left, bottom-right */
corner-shape: superellipse(-1.2) square squircle;

/* Four values - top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left */
corner-shape: scoop superellipse(-1.6) superellipse(-2.2) round;
```

## How corner-shape Works with border-radius

The `corner-shape` property only has an effect when `border-radius` is applied to an element. If `border-radius` is `0` or not set, `corner-shape` will have no visible effect.

The property modifies the shape of the rounded area defined by `border-radius`. For example:
- With `border-radius: 20px` and `corner-shape: round`, you get circular rounded corners
- With `border-radius: 20px` and `corner-shape: bevel`, you get beveled corners with a 20px diagonal cut
- With `border-radius: 20px` and `corner-shape: squircle`, you get a squircle shape with 20px rounding

## Visual Effects

When you apply `corner-shape`, it affects not just the element's shape, but also:
- Borders follow the defined corner shape
- Outlines follow the defined corner shape
- Box shadows follow the defined corner shape
- Background effects follow the defined corner shape

This means the entire visual appearance of the element, including all its decorative properties, will conform to the specified corner shape.

## Browser Compatibility

The `corner-shape` property is currently experimental and has limited browser support:

- **Supported**: Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
- **Not Supported**: Safari, Firefox

This is an experimental technology, so browser compatibility should be checked carefully before using in production. The property is not yet part of the Baseline web standards.

## Use Cases

The `corner-shape` property opens up new design possibilities:

- **Modern UI Design**: Create distinctive corner styles that stand out from traditional rounded corners
- **Brand Identity**: Use unique corner shapes as part of a brand's visual language
- **Design Systems**: Implement consistent corner styles across a design system
- **Creative Layouts**: Experiment with different corner styles for cards, buttons, and containers
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Use different corner shapes to create visual distinction between elements

## Examples

### Beveled Corners
```css
.element {
  border-radius: 20px;
  corner-shape: bevel;
}
```

### Squircle Shape
```css
.element {
  border-radius: 30px;
  corner-shape: squircle;
}
```

### Mixed Corner Styles
```css
.element {
  border-radius: 25px;
  corner-shape: round bevel; /* top-left & bottom-right: round, top-right & bottom-left: bevel */
}
```

### Custom Superellipse
```css
.element {
  border-radius: 40px;
  corner-shape: superellipse(0.8);
}
```

## Animation

Different `corner-shape` values can be smoothly animated between. The browser uses the `superellipse()` equivalents of keyword values for interpolation, allowing for smooth transitions between corner styles.

## Related Properties

The `corner-shape` property is a shorthand for these individual corner properties:
- `corner-top-left-shape`
- `corner-top-right-shape`
- `corner-bottom-right-shape`
- `corner-bottom-left-shape`

You can also use side shorthands:
- `corner-top-shape` (top-left and top-right)
- `corner-right-shape` (top-right and bottom-right)
- `corner-bottom-shape` (bottom-right and bottom-left)
- `corner-left-shape` (bottom-left and top-left)
